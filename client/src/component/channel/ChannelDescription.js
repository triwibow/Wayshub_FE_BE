            <p> Founded in 2017, BBQ Mountain Boys is a collaboration of couple friends who wanted to convey their modern outdoor lifestyle through their Coffee Farm & Creative Space called SAUX. Our bohemian Coffee Farm & Creative Space nestled amongst the pine trees on a mountainside. </p>
            <p>Inside our log cabin, a jewelry artist concurrently BBQ pitmaster and a blacksmith that also a farmer at the same time, work side by side. Away from the hustle and bustle of city life where creative minds can wander free.</p>
            <p>By BBQ Mountain Boys Youtube Channel, we want to show you how we enjoy our life inside the forest. How we live, how we cook, how we take care of our coffee plantation, and how we spend the time and make some fun. We hope through our YouTube channel, we can inspire you to enjoy life in a different way and closer to nature. Because nature is very beautiful! </p>
